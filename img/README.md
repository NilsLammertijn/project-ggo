```
<p align="left">
  <img src="img/prototype1" width="32%">
  <img src="img/prototype2" width="32%">
  <img src="imgprototype2" width="32%">
</p>

- ❗Make sure you have asked for permission when you show persons
- ❗If it's not needed to show the faces of people (camera angle or blur), prefer this.
